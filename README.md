# Car-Sales-And-Inventory-Store

## APP OVERVIEW
After studying the relevant existing system, we plan to develop a website system that will eliminate the paperwork system to maintain the cars records thus reducing loss of data as the vehicle sale records will never be lost or destroyed physically. The system will provide users with efficient working environment and also reduce the amount of time spent when retrieving past records as all the process will now become automated.  This system will provide the user with friendly interface resulting in knowing each and every usability feature of the system. There will be no more double sales as once the vehicle will be sold, it will be reserved for the right customer. This will make it easy to retrieve, update and backup data. The present system should capture the customersâ€™ orders in case the customers the wants the car that is not present in the showroom and tells the company to order for him/her instead the user rights on the paper.
